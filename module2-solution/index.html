        <p>Turtwig is a small, light green, quadrupedal Pokémon resembling a turtle or tortoise.
        Its eyes, feet, and lower jaw are yellow. Its body is covered by a brown shell that is composed of earth.
        The shell has a thick black stripe and a black rim. On a very healthy Turtwig, the shell should feel moist.
        A small seedling grows on a brown patch on its head.
        This seedling will wilt if the Pokémon becomes thirsty.
        Since it is a plant-based Pokémon, Turtwig usually nourishes itself through photosynthesis.
        It also drinks water, which hardens its soil-based shell.
        Due to its status as a starter Pokémon, a wild Turtwig is hard to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers.</p>

        <p>Chimchar is a bipedal Pokémon resembling a chimpanzee.
         Its fur is primarily a shade of orange, though its face, outer ears,
          underbelly, hands, and feet are light yellow. Its rear has a small, round,
          red patch that is usually obscured by flames produced by burning gas in its stomach.
           These flames go out when it goes to sleep, and burn weakly when it feels ill.
           Chimchar's ears are large in comparison to its head size and red inside.
           It has two pointed teeth in its upper jaw.
           Chimchar has red markings nearly surrounding its eyes, a swirl-like symbol on its chest,
           and five fingers on its hands with three toes on its feet.
           It has a swirly crest of hair on its head.
           Being very agile, it is able to climb the rocky ledges of tall mountains, where it lives.</p>

        <p class ="pip">Piplup is a light-blue, penguin-like Pokémon,
        which is covered in thick down to insulate against the cold.
        It has a dark blue head with a primarily white face and a short, yellow beak.
        The dark blue feathers on its head extend down its back and around its neck,
        which causes it to appear to be wearing a cape.
        There are two white ovals on its chest and a small, light-blue marking resembles a crown above its beak. It has flipper-like arms and yellow feet with three toes each.

          Piplup has a strong sense of self-pride.
          Because of its pride, it has a hard time accepting food from humans and bonding with its caretakers.
          It will even puff out its chest after it falls down,
          which it often does due to its poor walking abilities.
          However, it is a skilled swimmer that can dive for over ten minutes in order to hunt.
          It has also been shown to fly short distances in the anime.
          It lives along the seashore in colder climates.</p>
